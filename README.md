Enjoy this "game" at [this url](https://protothor.github.io/ants/ "https://protothor.github.io/ants/")

This is called "ants" after Langton's Ants. It technically incorrect because it's more like the turmites concept. Regardless, just enjoy the fun part of the page by making fun patterns. I will shortly post the multi solver that makes images of this in C. I've become certain that is wild and has a series of patterns that I haven't figured out how they relate to one another.

You can set the width, height, and scale as a base. It defaults to your window size, which you can use F11 to make full screen. Your width or height can be measured as the other by filling the normally integer options with a non-numerical character.

You can also set the instructions (lfrb) left, forward, right or backward.

You can also set the number of ants.
